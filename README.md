Hey there, I’m Ian Riua.

Data Analyst | Python & SQL Developer | Data Science & IT Specialist 

**About Me**

I’m deeply inspired by the transformative power of data — how raw numbers can be shaped into insights that inform smarter decisions, drive innovation, and solve real-world challenges.

My journey began with a background in Business Information Technology, which gave me a strong foundation in systems, logic, and organizational processes. Recently, I completed a Data Science bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience in:

🧠 Machine Learning: Building predictive models and uncovering trends in data

💾 Data Analysis & Visualization: Using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to turn data into clear stories

🔍 ETL & Automation: Streamlining workflows and improving data accessibility

📊 Business Insight Generation: Bridging the gap between data and strategy

I’m looking to connect with like-minded professionals, mentors, and teams passionate about leveraging data to create impact — whether through:

Open-source collaborations

Real-world analytics projects

Internships or entry-level data roles

If you believe in the power of data to drive better outcomes, I’d love to be part of your mission.

***⚡ Fun Fact***

For every line of code, I consume at least two cups of coffee ☕ — because in a world full of outliers, I’m proudly the anomaly.
